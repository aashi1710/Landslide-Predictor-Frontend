We will use Google Colab, which is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing access free of charge to computing resources including GPUs, for our backend (machine learning and deep learning).

Lastly, we will connect our Colab notebook to a web app using REACTJS to create an interactive application for users that is very accessible.

Our web application is a culmination of better information and easy accessibility, that'll help users to predict landslides quickly
